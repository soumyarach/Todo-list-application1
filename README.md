# What I Built ? 
I built this simple console-based To-Do list manager in python.The code allows users to add,remove,and view tasks & it presists the tasks in a file named tasks.txt  . 
# Why I Built it ? 
I built this To-Do list manager to meet the requirements specified,which included:                                                          *Creating a console-based application                                                                                                 *Implementing basic to-do list functionality(add,remove,view tasks)                                                                       *Persisting tasks in a file                                                                                                             *Providing a simple and intuitive user interface
# How I Built it ? 
1.Task Storage :-
*I used a list to store tasks in memory.
*I used a file named tasks.txt to persist tasks across program program runs.

2.Loading and Saving Tasks:-
*I defined a load_tasks function to load tasks from the file when the programs starts.
*I defined a Save_tasks function to save tasks to the file whenever a task is added or removed.

3.Task Management:-
*I defined an add_task function to add new tasks from the list.
*I defined a remove_task function to remove tasks from the list.
*I defined a view_tasks function to display all tasks in the list.

4.User Interface:-
*I used a while loop to provide a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the to_do list.
*I used input statements to get user input and perform actions based on the user's choice.

5.Error Handling:-
*I used try-except blocks to handle errors that may occur when loading or saving tasks,or when removing tasks

# Overview:-
Overall,I Build the To-Do list Manager to provide a simple and functional application that meets the specified requirements.
